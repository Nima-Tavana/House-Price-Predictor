<h3>What is Multiple Linear Regression?</h3>
<h4>Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that is used to predict the outcome of a variable based on the value of two or more variables. It is sometimes known simply as multiple regression, and it is an extension of linear regression. The variable that we want to predict is known as the dependent variable, while the variables we use to predict the value of the dependent variable are known as independent or explanatory variables.</h4>
<h4>Regression models are used to describe relationships between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.</h4>
